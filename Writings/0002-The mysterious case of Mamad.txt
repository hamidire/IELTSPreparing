My writing is about a friend of mine, named Mamad. I know Mamad for a really long time. We have been together from middle school. Mamad is a very strange person, sometimes I think he has a screw loose although he is really successful in his job. I think calling him a geek is a better definition of him. He loves two things the most, the first one is Java ( a programming language) and the other one, I would rather not to say because I think he wouldn’t be happy If I tell this to people in my English class or anybody in the world.
I, Mamad and Hamid were colleagues about one year ago. At that time we used to go to cafe after the work and talked about anything in the life although we used to start our meetings by talking behind our boss back. Anyway, once we talked about Marriage and Mamad introduced us to one of his secret aspect of his character that we couldn’t find out about it in that many years of friendship. He was talking about his ideal girl and then he said: “You know guys, I have always been a family man I love to spend time with my future family.” Me and Hamid stared at each other and at the same time said “What?!”. We said to him “you come to work early in the morning and after work you spend time with us until midnight, How could you be a family man when you always would rather to be with your friends?". As usual he tried to convince us that he is right and as we knew there was no possibility we could persuade him. So we pretended that we have accepted his reasons.
Anyway, I have learned that every good writings must have a conclusion so I dedicate this conclusion to my friend's point of view. Do not judge people based on what you see, or even based on what you hear. There is a dream or fantasy of being a human in everybody that we could not see.
