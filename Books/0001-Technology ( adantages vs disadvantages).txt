There is always a debate between people who loves technology and  wants it without any limits and boundaries and people who thinks technology is against of human nature and there must be some restrictions for it. At first we discus about positive aspects of technology and then we tell the story of the opponents.
Technology has eased our life in many ways. With the help of technology we could do more than what our ancestors used to do. For example we could have fresh and hot food anytime we want, in less than 30 minutes with the help of a microwave. Or we could travel from one city, to a city on the other side of the world in just a day. there was a time, it seemed impossible or at least you needed to prepare yourself for a really long travel but now you could buy the ticket for tomorrow’s flight on the internet.
On the other side, technology has brought us it’s own drawbacks. since smart phones came to our life, our memories have been so much weaker. There was a time every person memorized the phone number or address of at least some of his or her relatives but now you just need to remember to touch on your smart phone screen. People would have loosen on their own hometown without the usage of navigation applications.
Once,  Audrey Hepburn  said “Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible’!”. she said it as if she had seen the future. The technology changed this slogan to a fact. So we must believe that technology is helping us to reach our dreams. We need to adopt ourselves with it and try to avoid it’s negative effects.
